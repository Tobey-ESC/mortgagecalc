# STREAMLIT | Python makes everything easy!

### Hey everyone! 

This project is inspired by the Streamlit app for mortgage repayments calculator seen on Youtube but there are features added by me!

The app calculates the repayments based on the loan amount, interest rates, length of the payment and if you deposited any amount - the calculation was based on the tutorial but I refactored it for better results.

## Features that I added

Certain features was added:

### Payment frequency options
- Users can adjust the interest rate for bi-weekly, weekly and monthly payments

### Amortization schedule download
- Users can download the amortization schedules in a CSV file

### Optional feature - Prepayment calculator
- Enable users to calculate the impact of making prepayments on their loan term and interest paid.

### An interactive chart for loan repayment breakdown
- interactive charts to visualize the breakdown of principal, interest, and total payments over time.


### Lastly, Educational Resources and Mortgage FAQs: 
- Just a static for providing answers to common mortgage-related questions and offering advice on choosing the right mortgage, understanding mortgage terms, and improving credit scores.
